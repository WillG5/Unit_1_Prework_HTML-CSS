		<p>Hello all and welcome to my page. My name is William or you can just call me Will. I am 29 years old and I have attained my Associates degree at Wayne County Community College. I am currently attending the Grand Circus IT bootcamp for web design, and I am truly excited to be apart of this program and making a change in my life as well. Thank you for your time and I hope you enjoy my site.</p>
		<p>The motivation I have for attending this boot camp is to give myself the groundwork to start in the IT field. With traditional schooling, It is hard to keep up with specific career classes because of the short semester (3 months) and then moving on to or doing other subjects such as math and English in that same semester. Being in this particular boot camp, it will just center around IT as well as landing a job, and proper etiquette to be successful with my career. That is why Iâ€™m both excited and motivated to start my journey as an IT professional. I know the road will be a rocky one, but I have the ambition and drive to succeed.</p>
		<p>I also have a passion for beer, I love trying new things and with that being said, I constantly try different beers. The picture below was taken at Ashley's in Westland.</p>
