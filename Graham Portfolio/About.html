	<h2>A few things about me are:</h2>
<ol>

	<li>I love cooking, I would go on different cooking sites and try out different recipes for me and my family. The most recent dish I prepared was a nacho casserole with Cool Ranch, Sweet Chili, and Original Doritos</li>
<br>

<li>I love anime. One of my favorites is Gurren Lagaan. Hands down one of the most under-rated animes out there. Currently I am watching a multitude of shows including my favorite My Hero Academia, Boruto, Dragon Ball Super, the Gundam Build series and Darling in the Frankxxx.<br> The site that I go to for some of my anime watching needs is:<div id="shows"><a href="https://www.funimation.com/">Funimation.com</a></div></li>

<br>

<li>I am a huge gamer, and as I look towards the future I don't think that will ever change. I currently have a PS4 and I mostly play Monster Hunter, Ghost Recon Wildlands, The Division, and Gundam Breaker 3.</li>
